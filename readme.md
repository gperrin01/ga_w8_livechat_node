this is in essence very annoying. All I've been doing for the past 45 minutes is copy a series of instructions for configurations and making several additions because additional lines of code were needed.

in the lab we call index what we call app here, and vice versa - great for clarity

I dislike this code-along approach where we copy what has to be done without being told how it works and wy. I feel like I can't reproduce it myself without explanation. You give us all the steps so my mind switches on automatic mode and I cannot think for myself
